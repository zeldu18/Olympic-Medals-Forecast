## Predict Olympics Medal Using Linear Regression

I built an end-to-end machine learning project. In this project, I predict the number of Olympic medals each country will get in 2016 based on their statistics in 2012 and 2008.

## Project Steps

1. Form a hypothesis. \n
2. Find and explore the data.
3. Reshape the data to predict the target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data into training and testing data.
7. Train a model.

## Data used
I used the data from the Olympics on [Kaggle](url).
