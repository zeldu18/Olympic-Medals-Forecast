## Predict Olympics Medal Using Linear Regression

I built an end-to-end machine learning project. In this project, I predict the number of Olympic medals each country will get in 2016 based on their statistics in 2012 and 2008.

## Project Steps

Form a hypothesis.
Find and explore the data.
(If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
Clean the data for ML.
Pick an error metric.
Split your data.
Train a model.

## Data used
I used the data from the Olympics on [Kaggle](url).
